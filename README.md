# Hybrid Differentiable Simulation: Improving Real-world Deployment through Data #

This repository was created for the course Foundations of Reinforcement Learning, held in the spring semester of 2024 at ETH Zurich. 

The purpose of this repository is three-fold:

1. It offers an open-source, parallelized implementation of <cite> Policy Optimization via Differentiable Simulation (PODS)</cite> [1] using <cite>JAX</cite> [2] and the <cite>BRAX</cite> [3] physics engine, since no such implementation is as of yet publicly available. 
2. To explore how well model-based reinforcement learning (particularly ones leveraging differentiable simulation) algorithms generalize to real world applications.
3. To explore whether using real-world data can mitigate the sim2real gap of said methods, as well as the known numerical stability issues that arise due to non-differentiable phenomena such as contact.
